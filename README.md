# Computer-Architecture-VU
Computer Architecture programs made in x86 assembly during the first semester of Vilnius University Software Engineering studies.

First Task: Caesars code. Letters input by the user in console will be output also to console in Caesars code (all letters will be shifted by 2 places. For example, A will become C).

Second Task: Hex Dump. Assembled program takes a command line argument which is supposed to be a file and then the data of that file is compiled into a text file that outputs the file's bytes in hexadecimal format, also ASCII equivalents are printed and offset is given.

Third Task: Partial Disassembler. Basically a program that takes compiled x86 assembly code and tries to recreate it to its original format and then writes it to a text file. It works but not with all commands.
